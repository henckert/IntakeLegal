Incident Details:

On January 15, 2024, I was involved in a motor vehicle accident on the M50 motorway near the Red Cow interchange. I was driving southbound when another vehicle ran a red light and collided with the driver's side of my car.

As a result of the accident, I sustained the following injuries:
- Whiplash and neck pain
- Lower back strain
- Bruising on left shoulder and arm
- Ongoing headaches

I was taken to St. James's Hospital by ambulance and remained there for observation for 6 hours. I have been attending physiotherapy twice weekly since the accident and have been unable to return to my job as a retail manager.

The other driver's insurance company has contacted me, but I have not provided any statements yet. I have photographs of the accident scene and my vehicle damage, as well as copies of my medical records and prescription receipts.

I am seeking legal representation to pursue a personal injury claim for my injuries, lost wages, and pain and suffering.

Please advise on the next steps.

Thank you,
Jane Doe
